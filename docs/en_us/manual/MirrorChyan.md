## Using on MaaFramework Generic UI

Some MaaFramework generic UIs, such as [MFAAvalonia](https://github.com/SweetSmellFox/MFAAvalonia), [MFW-PyQt6](https://github.com/overflow65537/MFW-PyQt6), and [MFAWPF](https://github.com/SweetSmellFox/MFAWPF), have the functionality to update the UI and resources (like M9A) through MirrorChyan. You can configure this in the respective settings interface.

## Using the MirrorChyan Website

[Official Website](https://mirrorchyan.com). Most functions are displayed on the homepage. Here's an introduction to each:

1. Purchase Monthly Pass
    You can purchase directly from the homepage.
2. Query CDK
    [Query CDK](https://mirrorchyan.com/en/get-key). After purchase, you need to query the CDK using the order number (**Note: this and the following refer to the merchant order number**). This code is required for use.
    [Query Order Number](https://afdian.com/dashboard/order). If you don't know the order number, you can find it here or check the order details in your payment channel (e.g., Alipay).
3. Download the full M9A package
